Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## 2016 Themes

* Write more long form work and tutorials.
* Read more, and track each book.
* Sleep more. Never go to bed past 1 AM
* Become more T-shaped, learning a broader array of skills and getting deeper where it matters most.
