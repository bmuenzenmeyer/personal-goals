Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## 2017 Themes

* Prioritize my time better. Having our second child really accentuated what is important and what isn't.
* Write more long form work and tutorials.
~~* Read more, and track each book.~~ Enjoy reading when I can.
* Sleep more. Never go to bed past 1 AM
* Become more T-shaped, learning a broader array of skills and getting deeper where it matters most.
* Codepen more! Learn more, share more, experiment more.
