# Books I've Read 2016

## January
- [x] [You're My Favorite Client](http://abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client) - Mike Monteiro
  - The perfect compliment to [Design Is a Job](http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job), I found myself understanding more about the design profession and my role in client services by using Mike's experiences to force my perspective onto the other party. It's just chock-full of great insights, anecdotes, and terse advice. Reminded me on more than one occaison that designers exist to make you successful, not happy, and serve your goals more than fashion, their taste, or your politics. If you've read _Design is a Job_ and crave more, or want to understand what to expect from the designers on your team or at your company, pick this up.
- [x] [The Shape of Design](https://buyolympia.com/q/Item=frank-chimero-the-shape-of-design-paperback) - Frank Chimero
  - Reading this alongside _You're My Favorite Client_ was a fantastic one-two punch for me. I cannot think of anything that could instill more passion and heatfelt care into the craft of designing solutions than to read Frank Chimero's _The Shape of Design_. There are a lot of books and methodologies that instruct us on how to design, and the zeitgeist of the industry may tell us what the flavor of the moment is, but **nothing** comes close to teaching me _why_ we design. The book helped me understand the driver of design and the relationship between designer and audience that can and should seep into every creative act.  An absolute must-read I wish I'd picked up in more formative years, as if its contents bring movement to notions I could only hope to grasp before.
- [x] [The Martian](http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025) - Andy Weir
  - What a fun read. The internal dialog of Mark Watney is enough to keep this a page-turner from start to finish.

## February
- [x] [Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles) - Ethan Marcotte

## March
- [x] [Outbound Flight](http://www.amazon.com/Outbound-Flight-Star-Wars-Legends/dp/034545684X) - Timothy Zahn
 - Having grown up on _Star Wars_ books - I felt a strange nostalgia to staying up at night and reading this Thrawn backstory. Megan encouraged me to pick it up at the library with gentle geek-poking, and I'm glad I did. Both for enjoyment and for further showing Max that reading is a fun, rewarding endeavor. Heck, already he stays up with his flashlight and reads to himself or his stuffed animals. _Outbound Flight_, to me, is the intersection of so many _Star Wars_ storylines - it has pre-Clone War Jedi action & politics complete with Mace Windu, Obi Wan and Anakin wrestling with Palpatine - it has Thrawn as tactical as he ever was in _TIE Fighter_ or the triology of his name, and it has whispers of the Yuuzhan Vong that plague the galaxy far after the events of the _Return of the Jedi_. A quick pace - some okay character development, and enough twists to keep the pages turning. Good read for anyone else wanting to connect cannon and legends.
- [x] [Millennium Falcon](http://www.amazon.com/Millennium-Falcon-Star-James-Luceno/dp/0345510054) - James Luceno
 - Wow these books are a bit of a guilty pleasure, a confluence of all my geeky encyclopedic recall of _Star Wars_ facts and Legends timeline accrued from my teen years. This book has some interesting story framing and is full of nostalgia just like _Outbound Flight_. My son picked this one due to the cover - and I am happy to report it didn't disappoint. 
- [x] [The Girl With All the Gifts](http://www.amazon.com/The-Girl-With-All-Gifts/dp/0316278157) -  M. R. Carey
